# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction

Bulldozer price prediction based on a Kaggle Competition.

We are given a set of data from previous bulldozers auction results and we need to predict the sale price.

The objective is to lower the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices as much as possible.
